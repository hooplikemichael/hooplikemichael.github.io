I thought about Strength and speed and durability. For my other style I thought about agility and flying. I believe that this can be a factor in winning. I firstly asked for help to lead to this where i'm at. Some powers like healing. Lastly i will like to include it also factors with the idea of equal stats

<p>I am choosing this certain one which was a celebrity portrait due to the fact that I did really well on it. I think that it was my best due to the amount of work that I put on the page and all other sorts of things like that. I chose the colors yellow and purple to go on the idea of lebron on the LA lakers. The creative process was making it darker and lighter to make a shadow effect. I also would like to include i did some shaders on it.

<p>I used images online and used the pen tool on it. 
I then used the term “gurre” to describe ware and efforts put in place for the coat of arms.
It just is going with the coat and arms.

	<p>I used the shape tool to create the builds and windows. I used long buildings and included some like squares and triangles to complete my buildings. The most challenging was doing the roads bc it was hard IMO </p>
